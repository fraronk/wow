[Full Changelog](https://github.com/DeadlyBossMods/DBM-SpellTimers/compare/r123...r124) [Previous Releases](https://github.com/DeadlyBossMods/DBM-SpellTimers/releases)

- Last of the fixes (hopefully)  
    - Default spells now differ between classic and retail.  
    - Invalid spell IDs are now removed from settings on load, to prevent any errors.  
    - Tracking spells are now enabled by default (wasn't shown as checked in GUI).  
    - Fixed remove button removing the last element, rather than the one clicked.
